Codility Question: https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/tape_equilibrium/

Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the minimal difference that can be achieved.

For example, given:

  A[0] = 3
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 2
  A[3] = 4
  A[4] = 3
the function should return 1, as explained above.

Program runs in O(N) time and O(N) space.
